# Server scripts to start or stop an Minecraft server
Start, stop and restart scripts for your Minecraft Server using Paper.

### What can I do with this?
This scripts don't only restart or stop and start your server.
This scripts can create backups and Plugin updates for GeyserMC and Floodgate. (You can also disable this).
#### What you need to use the bash files:
- You need an Minecraft [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) server runnig in `/opt/`
- You need an folder in your Minecraft Server called jar (Command: `mkdir jar`)
- And you also need this addons:  
`apt-get install screen` - screen to see  
`apt-get install sudo` - sudo is sudo  
`apt-get install zip` - zip to zip or unzip something  
`apt-get install wget` - wget to upload files (like plugins)  
`dpkg -l | grep <package name>` - to see if you have the package
