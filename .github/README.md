### What can I do with this?
These scripts won't only restart or stop and start your server.  
Furthermore these scripts can create backups, keep your software up to date and provide plugin updates for e.g. GeyserMC and Floodgate.  
[More informations here](https://forums.papermc.io/threads/paper-velocity-server-manage-scipts.251/)
  
#### What you need to use the bash files:
You need java to run the server you can [get a repository here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk)  
The v2.5 scripts installs everything (exept for java) what they need to work.

### How to install this?  
Go into your server folders `cd /myservers/server/niceserver/ ...` and paste this:
```
wget -q https://t1p.de/qjqgw -O server_installer-v1.0.sh && chmod +x server_installer-v1.0.sh && ./server_installer-v1.0.sh
```
After that, configure the start.sh file with `joe start.sh` or `nano start.sh` (`apt-get install nano`)  
And you are ready to start with `./start.sh`  
  
You can stop or restart the server with `./<stop|restart|start>.sh`
